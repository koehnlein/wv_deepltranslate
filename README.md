# TYPO3 extension `td_deepltranslate`

This extension is a fork of [wv_deepltranslate](https://github.com/web-vision/wv_deepltranslate/) which provides automated translation of pages, content and records
to languages supported by [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/de/docs-api/) in TYPO3 v12.

I created this fork to use deepl_translate in my private TYPO3 12 projects where I have no budget for the early access program of web-vision.

If you really depend on the extension better use the [early access program](https://www.web-vision.de/typo3-automatische-uebersetzungen-mit-deepl.html) web-vision.
